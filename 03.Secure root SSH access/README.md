The task was to disable direct SSH login as the root user on all application servers in the Stratos datacenter.
Administrators must log in as non-root users and elevate with sudo — improving traceability and 
reducing the risk of brute force / accidental destructive commands.

Disabling SSH root login makes servers safer, harder to attack, easier to audit, and less prone to accidental damage.
