Task 2:
As part of the temporary assignment to the Nautilus project, a developer named Yousuf requires access for a limited duration. 
To ensure smooth access management, a temporary user account with an expiry date is needed. 
Here's what you need to do:
Create a user named Yousuf on App Server 2 in Stratos Datacenter.
Set the expiry date to 2025-02-17, ensuring the user is created in lowercase as per standard protocol.

Steps:
1. Make sure you are root (or use sudo)
2. Create the user Yousuf (lowercase) with an expiry date
3. Verify the account and expiry
